# GGDP-data
Data for paper WEEDING OUT THE DEADLY THREATS BEHIND THE BOOM

## Introduction
As global climate and environmental issues continue to increase, Green Gross Domestic Product (GGDP) has become a more suitable indicator of economic health and development than Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This paper proposes a new climate-environment cost-based GGDP model in macro form, using shadow price that is more economically sound than existing GGDP models. We also introduce a new method called relation chain analysis to export the GGDP model to micro form. Our mathematical analysis predicts a positive impact of using our model on the global economy and climate. We demonstrate the feasibility of the model using China as an example and combining actual data to forecast the future impact.
